# Gmail API OAuth2 Credentials (for personal Gmail accounts)


# Quick Setup Summary:
# 1. Create OAuth2 credentials (Desktop app or Web application)
# 2. Add redirect URI: http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback
# 3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to this file
# 4. Run: npm run auth



# To set up:
# 1. Go to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
# 2. Create a new project or select an existing one
# 3. Enable the Gmail API for your project:
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
#    - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it
# 4. Create OAuth2 credentials:
#    - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
#    - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
#    - Application type: "Desktop app" (or "Web application" if you prefer)
#    - Give it a name and create
#    - Download the JSON file or copy the Client ID and Client Secret
# 5. Get your refresh token (one-time setup):
#    - Run: npm run auth
#    - This will open a browser for you to authorize the app
#    - After authorization, the refresh token will be saved to your .env file
#
# Note: Service accounts are only needed if you have Google Workspace and want
# to use domain-wide delegation. For personal Gmail accounts, OAuth2 is the
# correct approach.
